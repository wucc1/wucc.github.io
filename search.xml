<h2 id="Menu"><a href="#Menu" class="headerlink" title="Menu"></a>Menu</h2><p><a href="https://wucc1.github.io/Projects/">Projects</a>: Shows information about 60 projects that contain “Microservice” in their description and subject, including name, GitHub link, description, and commits.<br><a href="https://wucc1.github.io/General_changes/">General changes</a>: We identified 8,928 change instances. On this basis, We extracted and analyzed 8,928 commits from these projects to gain insights into their development and maintenance practices. Through our analysis, we have identified five categories including Perfective changes, Corrective changes, Preventive changes, Adaptive changes, and Other changes<br><a href="https://wucc1.github.io/Microservice-specific/">Microservice-specific changes</a>: Based on our dataset, we identified 1,194 microservice-specific changes that address these architectural complexities.</p>
